# Privacy policy

This bot does not store any data, despite requiring access to message content - this is [needed to receive embed data from message events](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object-message-structure). All data is dropped immediately after processing the message.

Additionally, the "Manage Messages" permission is [necessary to hide user embeds](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#edit-message) after replacing them.
